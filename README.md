# Timber
This project follows the information taught in Beginning C++ Game Programming by John Horton.
In this project I'll be recreating a game called Timber, inspired by Timberman on Steam.
This project is meant to introduce me to the basics of C++ programming as well as getting comfortable
with using Visual Studio and SFML.
